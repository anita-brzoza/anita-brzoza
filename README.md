## 💻 Projects

### [Detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms in Saccharomyces cerevisiae](https://github.com/anita-brzoza/university_projects/blob/main/NGS_data_analysis/REPORT.md)
Detection of SNPs in vac6 (wild type and mutant with impaired vacuole inheritance) and vac22 (wild type) strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Data from SRA study number SRP003355 published on 2010-10-12 in the National Center for Biotechnology Information Sequence Read Archive were used. The project used tools such as FastQC, MultiQC, Trimmomatic, bowtie2, SAMTOOLS, The Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) and VCFtools.
