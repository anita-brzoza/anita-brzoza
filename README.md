## 🧑🏼‍🔬👩🏼‍💻 About me

I am a microbiologist as well as a bioinformatician, and I used my skills to create a pipelined metagenomic analysis in QIIME 2 software on a sample data set as part of the research project "Bioinformatic modeling of the effects of probiotic supplementation on the microbiomes of carp (_Cyprinus carpio_) rearing ponds and digestive system". In addition, I have been self-studying programming in Python and R since 2020. I am a highly motivated, well-organized, and eager to gain experience. 

In my free time, I attend PTAstroBio (Polish Astrobiology Society) meetings, read books and follow SpaceX projects.

## 💻 Projects

### [Detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms in Saccharomyces cerevisiae](anita-brzoza/university_projects/NGS_data_analysis/REPORT.md)
Detection of SNPs in vac6 (wild type and mutant with impaired vacuole inheritance) and vac22 (wild type) strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Data from SRA study number SRP003355 published on 2010-10-12 in the National Center for Biotechnology Information Sequence Read Archive were used. The project used tools such as FastQC, MultiQC, Trimmomatic, bowtie2, SAMTOOLS, The Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) and VCFtools.


## 📂 Repositories

* [courses](anita-brzoza/courses/) - contain solutions from redesigned courses
* [university_projects](anita-brzoza/university_projects/) - contain directories of projects done during the bioinformatics degree program
